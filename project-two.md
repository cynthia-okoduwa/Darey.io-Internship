## WEB STACK IMPLEMENTATION (LEMP STACK)
In this project you will implement a similar stack as in [project-one](https://github.com/uzukwujp/Darey.io-Internship/blob/main/project-one.md), but with an alternative Web Server – NGINX, which is also very popular and widely used by many websites in the Internet

### Step 0 – Preparing prerequisites
- You need an AWS account and Ubuntu server provisioned. You can follow step 0 of [project-one](https://github.com/uzukwujp/Darey.io-Internship/blob/main/project-one.md) to achieve that.

- However instead of connecting to the EC2 instance with **Putty** you can use Git Bash. Download and install git bash from this video: [GitBash](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdwWe9COT9k)

- Launch Git Bash and run following command:

  `ssh -i <Your-private-key.pem> ubuntu@<EC2-Public-IP-address>`
  
- You should see something like the screenshot below on your console:
